About me-
I have been interested in Computers my whole life, but after starting with the family business in metallurgy. I moved into quality control and became the quality manager, which hammered in the need for accountability, communication, and thoroughness in my work. Even while working as a Quality Manager, I was interested in IT and took it upon myself to develop the network topography for the office, and move them into a paperless work system. After we achieved our 17025 accreditation, I set up the offsite backups for the data to meet the standard, as well as build and maintain the datacenter with the servers used for storage. I have now however left the quality business and am perusing a career in programming. After Finishing the code-camps online courses in CSS, HTML, and DJango, I moved to Colt Steele's Developer Bootcamp.
Now I am forging my own way as a full-stack Developer.
